# instagram_followers_checker
this program will help you find out who you are not mutually subscribed to on Instagram <br>
you just have to replace the word username on your actual username on Instagram and the same way with password <br>
don't forget to install instaloader before (write in the terminal "pip install instaloader") <br>
then just run the program and you will get the list of "bad people" - the people who are not follow you but you follow them
